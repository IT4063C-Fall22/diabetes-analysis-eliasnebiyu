    "*Hint 🦉 :* \n",
    " - you'll need to create a list/array/DataFrame with the above features.\n",
    " - you will need to transform that input using the `full_pipeline` before passing it to the model.\n",
    " - you can use the `predict()` method to make predictions\n",
    "   - linear regression model gives a prediction of 165.07515659\n",
    "   - polynomial regression model gives a prediction of 156.5625\n",
    " - At this point, the model is trained, and the processing pipelines are trained. Make sure you don't re-train the model again with the input.\n",
    "   - in other words, you should only use `transform()` calls not the `fit_transform()` and certainly not the `fit()`."
